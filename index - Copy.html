            For RNG pic commands, every pic will cost 5-50 tomis depending on the command. Don't be shy to ask for discounts, I'm easy to scam.

 <h2 id="headers">About</h2>
    <h4 id="desc2">A very scuffed bot. And by scuffed, we mean it. It's literally just a glorified pic sender.
        How fucking lazy is that? Not to mention how disgusting the pictures being sent are. It's like, a shithole, but
        with actual shit. If that even makes sense.
    </h4>
    <br>
    <h4 id="desc2">While being ungodly scuffed, Hisae was helped lots of people overcome loneliness, a disease every weeb
        had inevitably developed. While being disgusted at our creation, we can't help but smile at how filthy virgin weeabos praise
        what might possibly be the worst  bot in the entire digital omniverse.
    </h4>
    <br>
    <h4 id="desc2">And so, we just started getting drunk and left the bot be.</h4>
